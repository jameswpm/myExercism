I can see that I can improve my solution, but I don't know how can I do it. This solution pass for all the proposed tests and also to an additional test like below

       it('lonely letter yell', function () {
         var result = bob.hey('A!');
         expect(result).toEqual('Whoa, chill out!');
       });

Any comments are very welcome!
